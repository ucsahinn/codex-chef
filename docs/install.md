# Installation Guide

Codex Chef installs into the current user's Codex home. That is `~/.codex` by
default; when `CODEX_HOME` is set, the installer respects that path instead.
Start with a preview so the first real write is never a surprise.

## Prerequisites

- Codex CLI or Codex app installed.
- Git installed.
- Node.js 18 or newer for validation and optional skill installation.
- `npx` available for the default stdio MCP servers and verified public skill
  installation.
- Optional: Gitleaks for stronger pre-commit and pre-push scanning.
- Optional on Windows: `winget` and current Windows 11 for the best native
  sandbox path.
- `uvx` if you keep the default Serena semantic-code MCP enabled. Without
  `uvx`, disable Serena or expect the status board to report its setup note.

## PowerShell Install

Preview without writing:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1 -All -WhatIf
```

Inspect the manifest-backed operation plan without invoking either installer:

```bash
node scripts/plan-install.mjs --all --summary --redact-paths
node scripts/plan-install.mjs --all --json
```

List available manifest profiles and operations before reviewing the full JSON:

```bash
node scripts/plan-install.mjs --list-profiles
node scripts/plan-install.mjs --list-operations
```

The summary keeps normal previews short; the JSON and full human plan list
managed targets, optional global Git changes, curated skill commands, collision
policy, backup behavior, and risk level.
The profile copy operation includes `development.config.toml`,
`review.config.toml`, `ci.config.toml`, and `token-safe.config.toml`.

Default-enabled MCPs still have launcher prerequisites. Node/npx-backed MCPs
start after Node can download their pinned packages. Serena is default-enabled
for semantic code navigation, but it needs `uvx` and the pinned git source. If a
fresh machine does not have that launcher, either install `uvx` or set
`mcp_servers.serena.enabled = false` before expecting `/mcp` to show it live.

Install after the preview is correct:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ucsahinn/codex-chef.git
cd codex-chef
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1 -All -Interactive
```

Automation-friendly install without questions:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1 -All
```

Repair an existing global Codex setup:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1 -Repair -WhatIf
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1 -Repair
```

Repair mode is for machines that already have a Codex setup. It previews or
applies backup-backed reconciliation for Codex Chef-managed guidance, rules,
agent/profile files, the bundled plugin, all nine managed direct local
workflows, missing config blocks, and the local plugin marketplace entry. It
preserves unrelated marketplace plugins and never deletes user skills; extra
or duplicate global skills are reported as cleanup candidates.

Update an existing checkout and managed setup through the guided CLI:

```powershell
npm run chef -- --update
npm run chef -- --update --verbose-plan
npm run chef -- --update --apply
```

Without `--apply`, update mode does not change managed/global files; normal
CLI logs are still repo-local unless `--no-log` is supplied. The default
preview is concise; `npm run chef -- --update --verbose-plan` prints the full
install dry-run evidence. Apply mode requires a clean worktree and runs
`git pull --ff-only`. If the pull advances the repo, the same approved CLI
prints a fresh preview, continues local validation and managed refresh, then
verifies installed-runtime parity. If the repo is already current, apply refreshes managed
files through the backup-backed update mode. Update replaces Codex Chef-owned files, synchronizes
managed config tables, and preserves user-owned `config.toml` settings. It does not install curated global skills
or optional global Git guards; use `--install --apply` or `--skills --apply`
when you want those explicit surfaces.

Inspect or restore Codex Chef backup archives through the same CLI:

```powershell
npm run chef -- --backups
npm run chef:backups
npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id>
npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id> --restore
npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id> --delete
npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id> --restore --apply
npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id> --delete --apply
```

The list and inspect commands are metadata-only: they show backup archive
locations, manifest status, verified-restorable file counts, sizes, and hashes
without printing file contents. An archive is not labelled restorable until its
manifest, full file set, hashes, and target allowlist all pass. Restore is a
preview unless `--apply` is supplied. The apply path reads and verifies the
exact source bytes, creates a new rollback backup of current targets, and then
copies known Codex Chef-managed files back as a rollback-protected transaction.
Commit-pinned skill replacement backups use a namespaced manifest and restore
the previous skill tree exactly, rather than leaving files from the replacement.
Restore fails
closed unless a valid `codex-chef.backup.v1` manifest exactly matches every
archive file by path, size, and SHA-256; missing, extra, altered, or unsupported
control-plane files such as auth, hook, session, memory, and cache state are
rejected. `--json` follows the same behavior: write requests report explicit
`applyRequested`, `applied`, and `outcome` fields and do not return a preview as
an applied result. Delete is also preview-first: `--delete` prints the resolved
archive path without removing it, and `--delete --apply` removes only the
selected Codex Chef backup archive under the canonical backup root.

## Codex Chef CLI Reference

The root README keeps the first-run path short. Use this section when you need
the full operator reference.

```powershell
npm run chef
npm run chef -- --status
npm run chef -- --status --details
npm run chef -- --status --repo-only
npm run chef -- --preview
npm run chef -- --preview --verbose-plan
npm run chef -- --update
npm run chef -- --update --verbose-plan
npm run chef -- --backups
npm run chef:backups
npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id> --delete
npm run chef -- --reset --apply
npm run chef -- --repair --apply
npm run chef -- --install --apply
npm run chef -- --skills
npm run chef -- --mcp
npm run chef -- --routing
npm run chef -- --continuity
npm run chef -- --diagnostics
npm run chef -- --processes
npm run chef -- --auth
npm run chef -- --logs
npm run chef -- --help --lang tr
npm run chef -- --status --repo-only --no-log
```

The command center is state-aware. Before an interactive full install, it reads
the existing managed-file and curated-skill state and prints a compact preview.
A fresh or incomplete setup can continue to typed `APPLY`; an already complete
setup exits successfully without reinstalling; managed drift is directed to the
backup-backed repair flow instead of being presented as a clean first install.
Direct commands remain preview-first unless their documented `--apply` flag is
present.

`Skill status & catalog` separates commit-pinned upstream skills, bundled/direct
Codex Chef skills, other user-installed skills, and the total visible global
inventory. A same-named directory is not enough: upstream entries need matching
source provenance and bundled entries need valid managed ownership. Only
missing or invalid upstream entries are offered for individual installation;
bundled/direct drift routes to repair. User-installed skills are counted and
preserved.

`MCP connectors` reads the installed `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` and separates
configured-and-enabled, configured-but-disabled, cataloged-but-not-configured,
and user-added connectors. These are configuration states, not live-health
claims. `codex mcp list --json` proves configuration discovery only; live
server/tool health remains unprobed until `/mcp` in a restarted Codex session
or another actual initialization probe succeeds.

The default status board is compact. Add `--details` to restore the per-MCP
inventory, routing controls, context budget, setup notes, target/ambient Codex
comparison, and log metadata.

`--routing` shows the task-shape map, expected skills and MCPs, and the
operator reporting contract. Use `/agent` to inspect and close completed agent threads;
use `/ps` and `/stop` for live terminal work started by the current
Codex session. `--diagnostics` includes the Serena/MCP process-audit command
and other read-only evidence commands, but it does not stop processes or mutate
global files.

`--continuity` makes Control and Brain visible without changing either system.
It reports the `codex-control-router` skill, installed `codex_control` MCP
configuration, bundled Brain skill, and an explicitly configured
`CODEX_CHEF_BRAIN_HOME` vault. Immediate work remains in the current session;
Control activates only for an explicit delayed, background, recurring,
restart-resilient, monitored, or Control-managed request. Brain automatic
capture stays disabled, and all Brain writes remain preview-first and
apply-gated.

The CLI subprocess can verify installed Control configuration but cannot call
the current Codex session's MCP tools. Confirm live project health from the
active Codex session with the Control MCP (or use `codex-control status --json`
from the owner terminal). A Control project's `brainMapped: true` state is
separate from the local `CODEX_CHEF_BRAIN_HOME` vault; configuring one does not
silently configure or write the other.

Installed and ready skills do not execute by themselves. A skill enters Codex
context when the user names it or the task clearly matches its description;
live activation is proven when the assistant prints `Skill selected` and reads
the skill's `SKILL.md` before acting.

If GitHub release, push, or workflow checks fail because local GitHub
authentication is stale, refresh GitHub CLI or Git Credential Manager according
to your organization policy. Keep account-scoped credential repair outside this
repository and never paste tokens into repo files, logs, prompts, skills, rules,
or shell history.

Useful switches:

- `-All`: install Codex templates, the local Codex Chef plugin, specialist
  agents, profiles, rules, and verified public/first-party skills. It does not
  change global Git config.
- Every default managed install synchronizes all nine canonical local workflow
  sources to `AGENTS_HOME/skills/<name>`. This makes direct calls such as
  `$adaptive-agent-routing`, `$context-budget-planner`, `$fetch <url>`, `$seo
  <target>`, and `$evidence-research <question>` available without installing
  the plugin. Fetch disables implicit invocation; SEO and Evidence Research
  allow it only for unambiguous matching requests. If an exact direct target
  contains a foreign skill, installation fails before any managed write.
- The personal marketplace entry makes `codex-chef-workflows` discoverable; it
  does not install or enable the plugin. To use
  `$codex-chef-workflows:<skill-name>`, run `codex plugin add
  codex-chef-workflows@codex-chef --json` (or use `/plugins`) and start a new
  Codex session.
- The personal marketplace reads its plugin mirror from
  `AGENTS_HOME/plugins/sources/codex-chef-workflows` through a path relative to
  the marketplace root. A custom `AGENTS_HOME` is an installer destination,
  not proof that the active Codex host discovers that marketplace. For a
  non-default root, register it with `codex plugin marketplace add <root>` and
  verify the resolved root with `codex plugin marketplace list --json`.
- `-AdoptFetchSkill`: explicitly adopt only
  `AGENTS_HOME/skills/fetch` after a foreign-collision preflight. The Bash
  equivalent is `--adopt-fetch-skill`. Normal install and repair never infer
  this authority.
- `-AdoptSeoSkill`: explicitly adopt only `AGENTS_HOME/skills/seo` after
  reviewing the foreign collision. The Bash equivalent is
  `--adopt-seo-skill`.
- `-AdoptEvidenceResearchSkill`: explicitly adopt only
  `AGENTS_HOME/skills/evidence-research`. The Bash equivalent is
  `--adopt-evidence-research-skill`.
- `-AdoptDirectSkill <name>`: explicitly adopt another cataloged direct skill.
  The Bash equivalent is `--adopt-direct-skill=<name>`.
- `-InstallSkills`: install `catalog/skills.json` entries that have
  `install: true`, a verified `package` in `owner/repo` format, a full commit
  SHA, and a matching `skill` name. The installer fetches that exact commit,
  verifies the selected skill, stages and hashes a native copy, then atomically
  activates it. It does not execute fetched repository code or a
  registry-delivered installer. A matching valid Codex Chef provenance marker
  permits a backup-backed managed upgrade. An unmarked, foreign, or locally
  drifted same-name target is preserved and reported as skipped.
  `--adopt-existing` is intentionally not a broad installer flag: after
  reviewing that exact target, rerun only its printed
  `install-pinned-skill.mjs` command with `--adopt-existing`.
- `-InstallGitGuards`: install global Git ignore, global pre-commit hook, and
  set `core.excludesfile` plus `core.hooksPath`. This is intentionally separate
  because it affects every Git repository for the current user.
- `-Force`: overwrite managed Codex files after creating backups. Use this for
  deliberate upgrades only after reviewing `-WhatIf`; without it, existing
  `config.toml` is backed up and receives only missing Codex Chef blocks, while
  existing agent files and rules are skipped. The personal plugin marketplace
  file is not replaced; only the Codex Chef entry is added or updated after
  backup and unrelated plugin entries are preserved.
- `-Repair`: repair an existing setup with the shared repair engine. With
  `-WhatIf`, it prints a no-write repair plan. Without `-WhatIf`, it backs up
  and repairs managed drift. It does not delete user skills.
- `-NoBackup`: skip optional managed-file backups. Not recommended. It never
  disables the mandatory safety backup for a pinned-skill upgrade or explicit
  pinned-skill adoption.
- `-WhatIf`: preview file, Git, and skill operations without changing the real
  setup.
- `-Interactive`: ask before using custom Codex/Agents home values and before
  enabling optional global Git guards. It also asks whether to install the
  reviewed skills, whether to force-replace managed files after backup, and
  whether to continue after the plan summary. It never asks for tokens or
  credentials.
- `-PlainOutput`: use ASCII status markers instead of emoji, useful for older
  Windows consoles, CI logs, and terminals that render Unicode poorly.

## Bash Install (macOS, Linux, Or WSL)

Preview without writing:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --all --dry-run
```

Install after the preview is correct:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucsahinn/codex-chef.git
cd codex-chef
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh --all --interactive
```

Useful flags:

- `--all`: recommended full Codex Chef setup without global Git config changes.
- `--install-skills`
- `--adopt-fetch-skill`, `--adopt-seo-skill`, and
  `--adopt-evidence-research-skill`: adopt only the named foreign direct target
  after review; normal install and repair fail closed.
- `--adopt-direct-skill=<name>`: adopt another cataloged foreign direct target
  after review.
- `--install-git-guards`: opt in to global Git ignore and hook settings.
- `--force`: replace managed targets after backup; without it, existing
  `config.toml` is merged and other existing managed files are skipped. The
  personal plugin marketplace file is not replaced; only the Codex Chef entry
  is added or updated after backup and unrelated plugin entries are preserved.
- `--repair`: preview or apply backup-backed repair for an existing global
  Codex setup. Use it with `--dry-run` for a no-write plan.
- `--no-backup`
- `--dry-run`
- `--plain-output`: use ASCII status markers.
- `--interactive`: guided macOS/Linux/WSL setup with the same path, skills, force,
  Git-guard, and continue prompts.

Both installers finish with a capability board that lists the specialist
agents, default-ready MCP servers, disabled opt-in MCP connectors, bundled
plugin skills, reviewed global skills, enterprise routing profiles, and MCP
setup notes. The setup notes call out local tooling, OAuth authorization,
filesystem-path selection, broad/destructive graph-indexing, and
Supabase project/read-only requirements before a task needs that connector. Account,
database, production, broad filesystem, and broad/destructive graph-indexing
connectors remain disabled unless you explicitly enable them later. Local
codebase graph reads are enabled only with destructive/admin graph tools
disabled.
Agent role files are installed without per-agent model/reasoning pins. The
active profile and Codex runtime choose the task-appropriate balance; use
`token-safe.config.toml` for broad or long-running work that needs lower
verbosity and tighter tool-output limits without disabling skills, agents, or
MCPs.

Codex Chef treats its template as the canonical managed baseline and the
existing machine configuration as a user-owned overlay. Normal install and
repair preserve the user's model and reasoning choice, approval and sandbox
settings, project trust entries, custom MCP servers, and unrelated personal
plugin marketplace entries. Chef-managed agent/MCP safety tables are merged
and validated; `--force` remains the explicit replacement boundary. This keeps
the package global and reusable without turning one machine's profile or trust
state into a distributable default.

## What Gets Backed Up

Existing files are copied into:

```text
~/.codex/backups/codex-chef-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/
```

New backups also include `.codex-chef-backup.json`, a small manifest with the
operation, package version, platform, backup-relative paths, sizes, hashes, and
any archive issues detected while writing metadata.

The installer backs up managed targets before replacing them:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `config.toml`
- `rules/default.rules`
- `agents/*.toml`
- managed profile files in `CODEX_HOME`
- personal plugin marketplace file
- both managed plugin mirrors
- all managed direct-skill directories and ownership markers

Directory replacement is allowed only under the managed Codex or Agents home.
Before any write, the installer rejects symlink or junction components below
those roots so a managed-looking path cannot escape to another directory.

## Post-Install Checks

Restart Codex, then run:

```bash
codex doctor --summary
npm run codex:routing
npm run codex:status
npm run verify:install:runtime
codex exec --strict-config "Summarize the active Codex setup."
```

`npm run codex:routing` prints the enterprise routing board from
`catalog/routing-profiles.json`: task shapes, matching subagents, skills, MCPs,
and config/profile flags. The board is a visible routing contract, not a hidden
execution hook; risky account, deployment, database, destructive, and broad
filesystem actions still require explicit approval.

`npm run codex:status` is the end-user status board. It combines repo-only
starter health, installed-runtime drift, direct Codex doctor check summaries,
skill context-budget warnings, routing board summary, effective control summary,
and MCP setup notes. Use `npm run codex:status:all` when the real install
intentionally included curated skills and optional Git guards.

`npm run verify:install:runtime` is read-only. It checks the installed
`~/.codex` and `~/.agents` targets, checks managed agent, rule, profile, and
plugin files for source drift, then runs Codex CLI checks with `CODEX_HOME`
explicitly pointed at the installed target. If the ambient shell is reading a
sandbox or alternate `CODEX_HOME`, the verifier reports that drift as a warning
while still proving whether the installed target exposes the expected MCP
config.

Live probes print progress and use short per-probe timeouts. Add `--offline`
when live/network checks are unavailable, or `--no-mcp-probe` to validate the
managed install and Codex CLI without starting the MCP probe.

Inside Codex, use:

```text
/mcp
/skills
/plugins
/hooks
```

## Test Without Touching Your Real Setup

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CODEX_HOME = "$PWD\tmp\codex-home"
$env:AGENTS_HOME = "$PWD\tmp\agents-home"
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Force -WhatIf
```

Bash:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$PWD/tmp/codex-home" AGENTS_HOME="$PWD/tmp/agents-home" \
  ./scripts/install.sh --force --dry-run
```

Use non-dry-run temp homes only when you intentionally want a smoke install.
Remove `tmp/` only when you created it intentionally.

If you already have a Codex setup, inspect the repair plan first:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1 -Repair -WhatIf
```

If repair is clean, continue with the normal install command. Existing
`config.toml` is backed up and merged; existing user tables are preserved.
Other existing managed files are skipped unless you use `-Force` / `--force`
after reviewing the preview. The personal plugin marketplace keeps unrelated
entries and receives only the Codex Chef entry upsert after backup. When managed
drift exists, `-Repair` / `--repair` is the safer first step before force
replacement.

## Rollback

1. Close Codex.
2. List backup archives with `npm run chef -- --backups`.
3. Preview restore from the selected archive:
   `npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id> --restore`.
4. Apply only after the preview is correct:
   `npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id> --restore --apply`.
5. Restart Codex.
6. Run `codex doctor --summary`.

Restore creates a rollback backup of the current managed targets first. The
installer and CLI do not delete backups unless you explicitly run the
preview-first backup delete flow with `--apply`.
