# Security Model

The setup is designed for high-leverage local work without weakening the core
Codex safety model.

## Defaults

- `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` keeps writes inside the workspace by
  default.
- `approval_policy = "on-request"` keeps escalations interactive.
- Network access stays disabled in the workspace-write sandbox unless a trusted
  profile or explicit approval changes that.
- `shell_environment_policy` uses `inherit = "core"` and keeps default secret
  exclusions active so subprocesses do not inherit broad local token variables
  by default.
- Authenticated remote connectors are present as disabled examples.
- App/connector defaults keep destructive and open-world tools disabled unless
  a reviewed app-specific override changes them.
- Global command rules are narrow and biased toward read-only discovery and
  local verification.
- Reviewed local verification scripts such as `npm run build`, `npm run check`,
  `npm run validate`, `npm run dev`, and `npm run codex:status` are
  auto-approved. Arbitrary repository-controlled `npm run ...` scripts stay
  unmatched, and cleanup, deploy, publish, release, migration, dependency, and
  destructive script names prompt because package scripts can run arbitrary
  shell code from the current repository.
- `token-safe.config.toml` reduces verbosity, default reasoning, compaction
  threshold, and tool-output size without disabling skills, agents, MCP
  servers, memory, hooks, or apps.
- Deletion, cleanup, pruning, uninstall, overwrite, database drop/truncate, and
  other destructive operations require explicit user approval. Safe
  non-destructive work can continue while the destructive part waits.

## MCP Boundaries

MCP servers can expose tools outside the shell sandbox. Treat them as powerful
connectors, not harmless documentation helpers.

Rules used in this starter:

- OpenAI Docs and Context7 are documentation-oriented defaults.
- Playwright and Chrome DevTools are local browser verification tools; only
  evidence/navigation tools are allowlisted by default, while interaction,
  evaluation, upload, and request-detail tools stay prompt-gated or disabled.
- Codebase Memory is packaged as a local code-intelligence connector. Graph
  read/query tools are allowlisted, but indexing and destructive/admin graph
  tools stay prompt-gated or disabled because they write local graph state.
- GitHub, Figma, Linear, Notion, Sentry, Vercel, and Supabase are disabled until
  the user intentionally enables and authenticates them.
- Token values must come from environment variables, not repo files.
- External write-capable tools should use prompt approval.
- Reviewed documentation and reasoning MCP tools may use
  `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"`. Browser, semantic-code, and
  codebase-graph MCP servers use `default_tools_approval_mode = "prompt"` with
  explicit `enabled_tools` allowlists for evidence, navigation, and read-only
  graph queries. Browser request/response detail, browser interaction, symbol
  edits, graph indexing, memory writes, filesystem, account, database,
  production, deploy, publish, and mutating tools should use `"prompt"` or stay
  disabled.
- Browser network listing can be approved for local QA. Request/response
  detail tools such as Playwright `browser_network_request` and Chrome DevTools
  `get_network_request` stay prompt-gated or disabled because they may expose
  headers, cookies, or response bodies.
- The managed Playwright launcher uses `--isolated` and
  `--block-service-workers`, so its default browser profile is not persisted
  and service-worker registration cannot retain cross-task state.
- Windows npm-backed stdio launchers disable `cmd.exe` AutoRun with `/d`, use
  `/s /c npx.cmd`, and forward
  `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=1`. This prevents the inner `npx.cmd`
  lookup from preferring a workspace-local shadow command. The outer
  `cmd.exe` path is still resolved by the Codex host before the per-server
  environment exists; a fully path-independent static template cannot prove
  that outer launcher provenance on every Windows installation. Hosts that run
  Codex from untrusted working directories should also set
  `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=1` in the parent environment or
  materialize trusted absolute launcher paths for that machine.
- Apps/connectors also have a separate `[apps._default]` gate:
  `enabled = false`, `destructive_enabled = false`, and
  `open_world_enabled = false` are part of the reviewed templates.
- New MCP servers should prefer narrow config flags such as `enabled_tools`,
  `disabled_tools`, `startup_timeout_sec`, and `tool_timeout_sec` over broad
  prose-only instructions.
- Generated code-intelligence graph state such as `.codebase-memory/` stays out
  of source control unless it is explicitly reviewed for a private workflow.
- `catalog/mcp-servers.json` records source URL, auth mode, setup kind, setup
  hint, risk, approval mode, and default-enable rationale for each starter
  connector. Installers and `npm run codex:status` surface setup requirements
  without collecting credentials.

## Authorized Website Reconstruction

The bundled explicit-only `fetch` skill reconstructs client-observable website
behavior from real browser evidence. A URL-only invocation stays public,
passive, bounded, and local: no login, no external mutations, no production
endpoint replay, and no claim that server source, databases, secrets, or
private authorization logic were recovered.

Authenticated routes require explicit ownership or authorization, a dedicated
test account, and user-performed login in an ephemeral browser. The skill never
requests or persists credentials, cookies, storage state, unsanitized HAR, or
private browser profiles. Reconstructed login, registration, recovery, MFA,
and payment forms are inert or local mocks by default.

Remote page content is untrusted data. Network discovery starts from an exact
origin, revalidates redirects, rejects private or metadata destinations, uses
bounded public `GET`/`HEAD`, honors applicable robots restrictions, and does not
bypass CAPTCHA, paywalls, rate limits, anti-bot controls, or access checks.
Protected assets require user ownership or reuse permission. Local output is
zero-egress by default and commit, publish, deploy, account, database, or other
external writes remain separately approval-gated.

## SEO And Evidence Research Integrity

The bundled `$seo` workflow distinguishes local source, locally rendered,
deployed-public, and authorized account evidence. It does not turn a passing
build, sitemap entry, Lighthouse run, or structured-data validator into a claim
that a URL is indexed, ranking, receiving field traffic, or eligible for a
visible rich result. Search Console, analytics, sitemap submission, DNS,
production redirects, publication, listings, outreach, and deployment stay
behind their own authorization and external-write gates.

The bundled `$evidence-research` workflow requires a charter, reproducible
search log at the claimed rigor, checked source records, claim-level references,
confidence, disagreement, limitations, and explicit separation of facts,
inferences, and recommendations. It never fabricates sources, interviews,
statistics, search counts, or systematic-review compliance. Paid APIs, private
datasets, participant contact, surveys, licensed material, and publication
require explicit approval. Both skills reject credentials and secret-like
material in their machine-checkable reports.

## Skill Sources

Installable skills must be represented in both `catalog/skills.json` and
`catalog/skills-lock.json`. The lock records the package, full upstream commit
SHA, skill, exact Skills CLI version, registry integrity, and install command.
The installer fetches the locked commit into an isolated temporary checkout,
verifies `HEAD` and the selected skill, stages and hashes an exact native copy,
and activates it without executing fetched repository code or the recorded
registry package. The CLI metadata remains a compatibility/discovery pin. The
default gate checks this contract offline; `npm run
verify:skills:online` verifies every pinned checkout and the npm integrity value.
An absent target is installed directly. A valid, internally consistent Codex
Chef provenance marker permits a managed upgrade with a mandatory full-tree
backup. Unmarked, foreign, or locally drifted same-name targets are preserved
by default. Adoption is deliberately per-skill: the operator must inspect the
exact target and rerun only that helper command with `--adopt-existing`; there
is no broad installer adoption switch.

Default command approval rules do not auto-allow global skill installation.
Read-only Skills CLI discovery can be allowlisted, but `skills add` and broad
Skills CLI invocations prompt because they change the agent instruction supply
chain.

## Specialist Agent Boundaries

Specialist agents are tracked in `catalog/agents.json` and validated against
both Codex config templates and the role TOML files under
`templates/codex/agents/`.

Agent templates must not use `danger-full-access`,
`approval_policy = "never"`, or embedded token environment variable names.
Read-only specialists stay read-only, while verifier/release roles can use
`workspace-write` only for local evidence such as smoke-test output.
Agent role templates also avoid per-agent `model` and
`model_reasoning_effort` pins when the catalog marks those fields as `auto`.
That lets the active profile and Codex runtime choose the model/effort balance
without weakening role boundaries or approval gates.

`max_threads = 10` is a concurrency capacity ceiling, not permission to fan
out every task. Conditional routing normally uses one to four agents and only
for independent parallel work, noisy evidence isolation, or explicit user
delegation. Automatic role selection never overrides the user's active profile.

## Install Planning And Collision Policy

`manifests/install-plan.json` records the managed install surface, risk level,
backup expectation, required flags, and collision policy for each operation.
`node scripts/plan-install.mjs --all --json` prints this plan without invoking
installers or mutating global state.

The manifest intentionally keeps ECC-inspired improvements narrow: plan/apply
separation and collision metadata are allowed; broad external config, MCP,
hook, telemetry, or skill catalogs are not imported by default.

The canonical template and user-owned overlay are separate trust domains.
Normal merge/repair preserves model/profile choice, approval and sandbox
settings, project trust, custom MCPs, and unrelated marketplace entries.
Chef-managed agent/MCP safety tables remain validated, while wholesale
replacement requires the explicit force path and a backup.
The generated `full` and `multi-session` profiles retain the installed local
MCP transport definitions and change only their enabled state, so selecting a
profile cannot turn a local MCP entry into an incomplete command definition.
The interactive command center inspects this state before a full install. It
does not silently reinstall an already current setup or present managed drift as
a clean first install; current setups become a no-op, while drift is directed to
the explicit backup-backed repair boundary. The same status inspection treats
user-added skills and MCP connectors as preserved inventory, not deletion
targets.
`scripts/validate-install-plan.mjs` also keeps destinations inside reviewed
Codex, Agents, and optional Git-guard targets so adjacent harness homes such as
`.claude`, `.cursor`, `.opencode`, `.zed`, and `.vscode` cannot drift into the
install surface silently.

Installers upsert only the `codex-chef-workflows` marketplace entry. They do
not replace the full marketplace file, and they fail closed if an existing
marketplace file is invalid, unreadable, or not a JSON object.

The managed installer synchronizes all nine canonical local workflow
directories to `AGENTS_HOME/skills/<name>`, so direct invocation does not
depend on plugin installation. A durable per-skill ownership marker
distinguishes Chef-managed or exact legacy content from a foreign collision.
Foreign content fails before any managed write unless that exact target is
explicitly adopted. Updates are backup-backed and unrelated skill directories
and extra files are preserved. Fetch keeps `allow_implicit_invocation: false`;
SEO and Evidence Research allow implicit activation only when their
descriptions unambiguously match.

The marketplace entry points to a managed mirror under
`AGENTS_HOME/plugins/sources/codex-chef-workflows`, which always stays inside
the marketplace root required by the current Codex schema. This registration
makes the plugin discoverable, not installed or enabled; namespaced plugin use
requires an explicit plugin install and a new session. Marketplace JSON,
direct-skill ownership, and every existing path component are preflighted
before installers write any managed file. Linked or junctioned descendants
that escape the configured homes fail closed.

After that explicit first plugin install, installer, repair, and update applies
inspect the installed plugin version through the targeted `CODEX_HOME`. They
run `codex plugin add codex-chef-workflows@codex-chef --json` only when the
plugin is already installed and its versioned cache is stale, then read the
installed version again before reporting success. A missing or uninstalled
plugin remains uninstalled, and a failed refresh fails closed instead of
claiming runtime parity.

## Repair Mode

`scripts/repair-install.mjs` is the repair/reconcile path for users who already
have a global Codex setup. Without `--apply`, it is read-only and reports
managed drift, missing config blocks, marketplace drift, extra managed plugin
files, non-curated skills, and duplicate skill names. With `--apply`, it backs
up and repairs only Codex Chef-managed files, merges missing config blocks, and
updates the Codex Chef marketplace entry while preserving unrelated marketplace
plugins. It also reports or refreshes stale versioned cache state only for an
already-installed Codex Chef plugin.

Repair mode does not delete user skills. Extra global skills and duplicate
skill names are cleanup candidates because they can pressure Codex's initial
skill-list budget, but they may have been installed intentionally. Deleting
extra files inside the managed Codex Chef plugin directory requires the
explicit `--prune-managed-plugin-extras` flag and still stays scoped to that
single managed plugin target after backup.

## Update Mode

`npm run chef -- --update` does not change managed/global files; ordinary
repo-local CLI logs are still written unless `--no-log` is supplied. It uses
the managed-file install plan and installer dry-run path, excluding curated
global skill installs and optional global Git guards.
`npm run chef -- --update --apply` first requires a clean Git worktree, then
runs `git pull --ff-only`. If new commits are pulled, it prints a fresh preview
from the updated tree and stops. If the repository is already current, it runs
local validation before the managed refresh, then refreshes scoped managed
Codex Chef files through the backup-backed installer. That refresh may backup
and replace scoped managed targets, including the managed Codex Chef plugin
directory, and refreshes an already-installed stale plugin cache in place. It
does not install the plugin for users who have not opted in or publish. It does
not perform unscoped cleanup, install curated
global skills, install optional global Git guards, delete user skills, rotate
credentials, or enable account/database/broad-filesystem connectors.

## Backup Inventory And Restore

`npm run chef -- --backups` lists backup archives under the active Codex home
without changing global/user state. `npm run chef -- --backups --backup <id>`
inspects backup archive metadata only: paths, sizes, hashes, manifest status,
issues, and restorable targets. It does not print file contents.

Restore treats backup archives as untrusted input. `npm run chef -- --backups
--backup <id> --restore` is a preview. The apply path requires `--apply`,
loads and verifies the exact source bytes, creates a fresh rollback backup of
current targets, rejects unsafe archive paths and symlinks, and restores only
known Codex Chef-managed files under the active Codex or Agents homes. If a
later write fails, already-written targets are restored from the fresh rollback
backup. Commit-pinned skill archives are limited to a cataloged skill ID and
replace that skill tree atomically enough to preserve exact-tree semantics
during handled failures. A valid `codex-chef.backup.v1` manifest must exactly
match the archive path, size, and SHA-256 set; legacy, missing, extra, altered,
or unsupported control-plane files fail closed. Inventory calls a backup
restorable only after those checks and the target allowlist pass. Backup archive
cleanup and deletion are not automated; they remain manual, reviewed operator
actions.

## Rules

`templates/codex/rules/default.rules` allows fast read-only discovery and
project-native verification commands. The reviewed allowlist includes granular
validators, release-note checks, skill/runtime verification, package dry-runs,
read-only Codex diagnostics, CI run watching, and read-only git object
inspection. It prompts for:

- destructive file operations
- deletion, cleanup, pruning, overwrite, and uninstall actions
- broad shell wrappers
- dependency installation
- global skill installation
- package publishing
- GitHub API operations, including auth status/token commands that can expose
  credential material
- arbitrary repository-controlled `npm run ...` script execution outside the
  reviewed local verification allowlist
- broad `git config` value-dump commands and raw, unredacted `gitleaks dir`
- git commit, push, reset, checkout, and restore
- repair apply and managed plugin pruning
- ad-hoc `npx` package execution outside exact allowlisted helpers

## Hooks

Hooks are useful for lifecycle checks, but they are not a primary security
boundary. Codex requires plugin hooks to be reviewed and trusted by exact source
hash before they run.

The local plugin declares one narrowly reviewed `SessionEnd` hook for process
hygiene. It reads no prompt or transcript text and injects no context. On normal
session end it captures only local MCP descendants of the exact Codex owner,
waits 45 seconds in a detached sweep, and stops only captured processes whose
PID and creation time still match after the owner chain is gone. Subagent
lifecycle events do not invoke `SessionEnd`. Missing process metadata,
live owners, recent trees, or PID reuse all fail closed.

The starter still rejects automatic `SessionStart` context injection,
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, unrelated hook runtimes, plugin-bundled
MCP/apps, and `Write` capabilities. `scripts/security-audit.mjs` allowlists the
exact process-hygiene hook path and command, then fails if hook runtimes appear
through root hook folders, other nested `hooks/` paths, `scripts/hooks`,
`.cursor/hooks`, `.kiro/hooks`, `.opencode` hook plugins, templates, or plugin
bundles without an explicit reviewed change. The hook never deletes files,
reads credentials, or treats unrelated Node/Python processes as cleanup
candidates.

Operational contract:
[multi-session process hygiene](process-hygiene.md).

## Git Hygiene

Global Git guards are optional because they modify the user's Git defaults.
When installed, they:

- keep obvious local secret and build-output paths ignored
- run Gitleaks when available
- block staged secret-like files such as `.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, `.pfx`

The repository `.gitleaks.toml` extends the default Gitleaks rules and only
excludes local scratch, dependency, build, and cache directories such as `tmp/`,
`node_modules/`, `dist/`, and `.next/`.

The hook is intentionally conservative and does not delete files.

Security validation also fails if tracked source files appear under ignored
scratch, dependency, build, coverage, or release-output directories.

## What Must Never Be Included

- Codex sessions or memories
- `.env` files
- private keys or signing material
- auth files, cookies, token caches
- local database dumps
- installers and release archives
- generated screenshots, logs, reports, and build output

## External Account Actions

The repo can document secure GitHub, Supabase, Vercel, or Sentry setup, but it
must not perform account-level actions automatically. Enabling repository
protections, rotating keys, changing billing, deploying, or publishing requires
separate user approval and account context.
