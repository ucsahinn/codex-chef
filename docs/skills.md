# Codex Chef Skills

[English](skills.md) | [Türkçe](skills.tr.md)

A skill is the **how** in a Codex workflow. It packages focused instructions,
references, and optional scripts so Codex can repeat a job without rebuilding
the process from scratch.

Codex uses progressive disclosure: it starts with a skill's name and
description, then reads the full `SKILL.md` only when the task matches or you
invoke the skill directly. That is why this catalog distinguishes what is
bundled, what the full install profile can add, and what remains an optional
reference.

## 🍱 Nine Bundled Workflows

These live in the Codex Chef plugin and travel with the repository. The
installer synchronizes all nine from that same canonical source to
`AGENTS_HOME/skills/<name>`, so every workflow can be called directly. Examples
include `$adaptive-agent-routing`, `$context-budget-planner`, `$fetch <url>`,
`$seo <target>`, and `$evidence-research <question>`. Fetch remains
explicit-only; SEO and Evidence Research can also activate when the request
unambiguously matches their descriptions.

The personal marketplace entry makes the plugin discoverable; it does not
install or enable it. To use namespaced calls such as
`$codex-chef-workflows:fetch`, install `codex-chef-workflows@codex-chef` from
`/plugins` or with `codex plugin add`, then start a new Codex session.

| Skill | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [`codex-chef-operator`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/codex-chef-operator/SKILL.md) | Keep this starter aligned without weakening installer or security boundaries. |
| [`codex-chef-brain`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/codex-chef-brain/SKILL.md) | Preview, capture, retrieve, back up, and restore selected project knowledge in a user-owned Markdown vault. |
| [`context-budget-planner`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/context-budget-planner/SKILL.md) | Plan sources, token use, compaction handoff, and verification for broad work. |
| [`adaptive-agent-routing`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/adaptive-agent-routing/SKILL.md) | Select the narrowest useful agent, skill, MCP, and wait policy without spawning by default. |
| [`external-review-workflow`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/external-review-workflow/SKILL.md) | Prepare a secret-safe, hash-pinned manual review handoff without uploading anything automatically. |
| [`fetch`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/fetch/SKILL.md) | Reconstruct an authorized reference site from browser evidence, verify responsive interactions, and report every fidelity gap without copying credentials or server internals. |
| [`seo`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/seo/SKILL.md) | Audit, implement, and verify technical, rendering, structured-data, content-intent, international, local, performance, and measurement work without inventing rankings or indexing evidence. |
| [`evidence-research`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/evidence-research/SKILL.md) | Frame decision questions, search and appraise current sources, trace claims, explain disagreement and uncertainty, and package reproducible research. |
| [`offline-diagram-triplet`](../plugins/codex-chef-workflows/skills/offline-diagram-triplet/SKILL.md) | Turn Mermaid source into editable Excalidraw, SVG, PNG, and Markdown assets without network access. |

## ✅ Fifteen Reviewed Full-Install Skills

These entries have `install: true` in the catalog. They are eligible for the
full install profile; the catalog pins the package/skill pair and the online
verification checks that the pair still resolves.

## 🧰 Other Cataloged Workflows

The following names remain discoverable, but Codex Chef does not automatically
install them. Some are local compatibility names; others are specialized
upstream options intentionally kept out of the default skill list.

<details>
<summary><strong>Debugging, implementation, review, and release</strong></summary>

- `investigate`, `incident-triage`, `new-feature`, `refactor-plan`,
  `test-backfill`, `performance-audit`, `db-migration-review`,
  `release-verify`, `code-review`, `sentry-code-review`, `codex-pr-body`,
  `babysit-pr`, and `open-pr`
- `git-hygiene`, `security-check`, and `security-threat-model`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Frontend, browser, and hosting references</strong></summary>

- `impeccable`, `design-taste-frontend`, `image-to-code`,
  `high-end-visual-design`, and `web-design-guidelines`
- `vercel-react-best-practices`, `vercel-optimize`,
  `vercel-cli-with-tokens`, and `playwright`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Context, prompts, memory, and MCP setup</strong></summary>

  `prompt-engineering-patterns`, `ai-prompt-engineering-safety-review`, and
  `memory-safety-patterns`

</details>

## What “Cataloged” Does And Does Not Mean

- A catalog entry is reviewed metadata, not proof that the skill is installed.
- A bundled skill lives in this repository's plugin. All nine bundled
  workflows are also synchronized as managed direct skills without creating a
  second canonical source in the repository.
- An `install: true` entry is eligible for the full install profile.
- A manual reference may overlap with a default skill or require credentials,
  vendor setup, or a more specialized task.
- Skills do not execute by themselves. Codex selects one when the task matches
  or when you explicitly invoke it.

The machine-readable source is
[`catalog/skills.json`](../catalog/skills.json). Reviewed install targets are
mirrored in [`catalog/skills-lock.json`](../catalog/skills-lock.json), including
full upstream commit SHAs plus dated Skills CLI compatibility/discovery
metadata. Installation itself uses a verified native-copy path.
