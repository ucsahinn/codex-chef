# Windows Notes

## Recommended Posture

- Prefer native Windows sandboxing when working in Windows repositories.
- Use the elevated sandbox when administrator-approved setup is available.
- Use WSL2 when your toolchain is Linux-native or native Windows sandbox setup
  is blocked by policy.
- Keep repositories under the native filesystem for the environment you are
  using. For WSL, keep repos under the Linux home directory for better I/O.

## Starter Defaults

The Windows template sets:

```toml
[windows]
sandbox = "elevated"
sandbox_private_desktop = true
```

If your machine cannot use elevated sandboxing, change to:

```toml
[windows]
sandbox = "unelevated"
```

Do not switch to unrestricted access as a routine workaround. Fix the sandbox
or use a narrower profile instead.

## Useful Checks

```powershell
codex doctor --summary
codex exec --strict-config "Summarize the active setup."
```

For repository scripts, use the Windows command shims explicitly in
PowerShell, especially from automation or agent-run processes:

```powershell
npm.cmd run check
npm.cmd run token:audit
npm.cmd run verify:install:runtime -- --no-mcp-probe
npx.cmd --version
codex.cmd --version
```

Codex Chef's programmatic command resolver selects `npm.cmd`, `npx.cmd`, and
`codex.cmd` on Windows and the un-suffixed commands on Unix. This avoids the
PowerShell script-policy and executable-resolution differences that can make a
command work interactively but fail in an agent or child process.

For additional temporary read access inside a session:

```text
/sandbox-add-read-dir C:\absolute\directory\path
```
