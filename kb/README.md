# Codex Chef Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is for short, task-shaped answers that users need after the
README. Use the docs for full reference, and use these articles when you need a
clear operating decision.

- [Turkish](README.tr.md)

## Operating Rules

- Prefer preview commands before installer writes.
- Keep account, database, production, and broad filesystem connectors disabled
  until a task explicitly needs them.
- Treat screenshots, logs, traces, and diagnostics as private until reviewed.
- Use `npm run check` and `gitleaks detect --redact --no-banner --no-git
  --verbose` before public handoff.
- Do not publish, push, tag, release, deploy, or change GitHub settings from an
  installer or unattended workflow.
